Cert Central is a personal project to explore how to enable code signing for every developer without paying to Certificate Authorities.

> Use X509 certificates as GPG keys

The project is available on [https://certcentral.x509.online/](https://certcentral.x509.online/) and the source code can be found on [https://github.com/x509online](https://github.com/x509online)

Recently I shared the project on Twitter and got a lot of feedback:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exactly !! But we should not pretend that all users will sign with CA issued certs. Why not use self signed as  GPG keys?
